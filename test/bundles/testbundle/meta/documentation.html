<p>Processed crime incidents, based on data supplied by SANDAG.</p>
<p>Important:</p>
<ul>
<li>See Caveats for limitations and warnings regarding this data. </li>
<li>Use of this data is subject to multiple terms and conditions. See Terms for details. </li>
</ul>
<p>This dataset includes geocoded crime incidents from 1 Jan 2007 to 31 March 2013 that were returned by SANDAG for Public Records request 12-075. </p>
<p>The extracts from the dataset include both CSV files, for use in spreadsheet applications, and ESRI shapefiles, for use in GIS applications. Both files are partitioned by year and include the following fields. Shapefiles also include point geometries for each incident. </p>
<p>Many of the columns use <a href="https://sandiegodata.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SDD/Clarinova+Place+Codes">Clarinova Place Codes</a> (CPC) to identify places, such as neighborhoods, council districts and communities. </p>
<ul>
<li>date: ISO date, in YY-MM-DD format</li>

<li>lat: Latitude, provided by the geocoder.</li>
<li>lon: Longitude, provided by the geocoder.</li>
<li>desc: Long description of incident. </li>
</ul>
<h1>City, District and Community Codes</h1>
<p>Four of the fields use custom codes to identify geographic regions: </p>
<ul>
<li>neighborhood/nbrhood</li>
<li>community</li>
<li>council</li>
<li>city</li>
</ul>
<p>These fields use <a href="https://sandiegodata.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SDD/Clarinova+Place+Codes">Clarinova Place Codes</a>, 6 character codes that are designed to be memorable and unambiguous. See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/clarinova.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhnSJoCKXnSUdE1SMXVDYzBGYjVXX3kwUkRBUi1NaHc#gid=0">place codes Google spreadsheet</a> for a list all of the codes. </p>
<h1>Asr_zone Codes</h1>
<p>The integer values in the asr_zone field are taken directly from the <a href="http://rdw.sandag.org/file_store/Parcel/Parcels.pdf">SANGIS parcel data</a>. These values are: </p>
<h1>Addresses and Geocoding</h1>
<p>SANDAG returns the position of incidents as a block address, and occasionally as an intersection. Block addresses are the original address of the incident, with the last two digits set to '00'. </p>
<p>Before geocoding, all of the original block addresses are normalized to be more consistent and to remove different versions of the same address. There are a few transformations performed on the address, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting street types synonyms like 'Avenue', 'Avenu' and 'ave.' to standard abbreviations like 'ave.'</li>
<li>Converting street directions ( 'West main Street' ) to abbreviations like 'W Main st'</li>
</ul>
<p>Many geocoders are designed to work with mailable addresses, and block addresses are not real postal addresses. This data is geocoded with custom code that uses the SANGIS streets database, matching the block addresses to a street segment. This produces more sensible results, because the crime is attributed to an entire block, rather than to an arbitrary point on the block. However, with the crime is represented as a point, it will appear at the location of the center of the street segment, usually in the middle of the block. </p>
<p>This means that all of the incidents on a block will appear at a single location. In most GIS programs, it is difficult to see that there are actually many points in one place. Be aware that each point you see may actually be dozens of incidents. </p>
<p>The files that SANDAG returned included 1,008,524 incident records, and 953,824 records were geocoded (95%). The 'gctype' field has a value of NONE when the  record was not geocoded, and any field that depends on a locations, such as x, y, lon, lat, segment_id, community, and others, will have default values. </p>
<h1>Caveats</h1>
<p>As with most crime data, there are many issues, limitations and problems that users must be aware of to avoid making incorrect conclusions. </p>
<p><em>Crime incident data is inherently problematic.</em> Crime incident reports are collected by busy officers in stressful situations who are trying to describe complex situations with rigid categories. Virtually every point of the data collection process has multiple opportunities for errors and few opportunities for correction after the fact. Analysts must consider the difficulties of collecting crime data when assessing the validity of any conclusions. </p>
<p><em>Data is collected by 19 different agencies.</em> While the data is all sourced from SANDAG, it originates with 19 different police departments. These departments may have different policies that can result in different categorizations for the same crime, and they may have different emphases on  which crimes they pursue. </p>
<p><em>Many incidents at a single point.</em> Because all of the crimes on a block are geocoded to the middle of the block, many incidents will appear as a single point. </p>
<p><em>5% of crimes are not geocoded</em>. GIS users should consider that about 5% of the incidents were not properly geocoded, and are not included in the shapefiles. These crimes appear in the CSV files, and can be included in time series analysis, but they will not be available for spatial analysis. </p>
<p><em>Time and dates are often unreliable</em> Time and dates for many incidents are unreliable, with times being more unreliable than dates. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Property crimes that occur while the owner is gone may be recorded as the time a responsible person left the property, arrived at the property to discover the crime, or the average between the two. There is no information available to select among these possibilities, so these incidents have very unreliable times. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because the time is unreliable, so is the date, for crimes that occurred at night. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Times may have not been recorded in the original report. These times may be entered as midnight, or as another time. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Multiple crime incidents may not have all crimes recorded.</em> If a single person is charged with multiple violations for a single arrest, departments may enter only the most serious charge, the last charge, or all of the charges. There is no information to disambiguate these possibilities. </p>
<p><em>Locations may be unreliable</em>. Crimes that involve pursuits or violations committed and multiple locations may be recorded and any of many different locations.  When the location is ambiguous, tt is common for incidents to have the address recorded as the location where the arrested person was charged. Because of this, the highest crime block in San Diego is the downtown police station. Check high crime locations to ensure they are not police stations. </p>
