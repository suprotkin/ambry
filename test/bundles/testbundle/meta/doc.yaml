        \n  * See Caveats for limitations and warnings regarding this data. \n  *\
        \ Use of this data is subject to multiple terms and conditions. See Terms\
        \ for details. \n\nThis dataset includes geocoded crime incidents from 1 Jan\

        \ in spreadsheet applications, and ESRI shapefiles, for use in GIS applications.\
        \ Both files are partitioned by year and include the following fields. Shapefiles\
        \ also include point geometries for each incident. \n\nMany of the columns\
        \ use [Clarinova Place Codes](https://sandiegodata.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SDD/Clarinova+Place+Codes)\
        \ (CPC) to identify places, such as neighborhoods, council districts and communities.\

        City, District and Community Codes\n===================================\n\n\
        Four of the fields use custom codes to identify geographic regions: \n\n \
        \ * neighborhood/nbrhood\n  * community\n  * council\n  * city\n\nThese fields\
        \ use [Clarinova Place Codes](https://sandiegodata.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SDD/Clarinova+Place+Codes),\
        \ 6 character codes that are designed to be memorable and unambiguous. See\
        \ the [place codes Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/clarinova.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AhnSJoCKXnSUdE1SMXVDYzBGYjVXX3kwUkRBUi1NaHc#gid=0)\
        \ for a list all of the codes. \n\nAsr\\_zone Codes\n===============\n\nThe\
        \ integer values in the asr\\_zone field are taken directly from the [SANGIS\
        \ parcel data](http://rdw.sandag.org/file_store/Parcel/Parcels.pdf). These\
        \ values are: \n\n\n\n\nAddresses and Geocoding\n=======================\n\
        SANDAG returns the position of incidents as a block address, and occasionally\
        \ as an intersection. Block addresses are the original address of the incident,\
        \ with the last two digits set to '00'. \n\nBefore geocoding, all of the original\
        \ block addresses are normalized to be more consistent and to remove different\
        \ versions of the same address. There are a few transformations performed\
        \ on the address, including:\n\n  * Converting street types synonyms like\
        \ 'Avenue', 'Avenu' and 'ave.' to standard abbreviations like 'ave.'\n  *\
        \ Converting street directions ( 'West main Street' ) to abbreviations like\
        \ 'W Main st'\n\nMany geocoders are designed to work with mailable addresses,\
        \ and block addresses are not real postal addresses. This data is geocoded\
        \ with custom code that uses the SANGIS streets database, matching the block\
        \ addresses to a street segment. This produces more sensible results, because\
        \ the crime is attributed to an entire block, rather than to an arbitrary\
        \ point on the block. However, with the crime is represented as a point, it\
        \ will appear at the location of the center of the street segment, usually\
        \ in the middle of the block. \n\nThis means that all of the incidents on\
        \ a block will appear at a single location. In most GIS programs, it is difficult\
        \ to see that there are actually many points in one place. Be aware that each\
        \ point you see may actually be dozens of incidents. \n\nThe files that SANDAG\
        \ returned included 1,008,524 incident records, and 953,824 records were geocoded\
        \ (95%). The 'gctype' field has a value of NONE when the  record was not geocoded,\
        \ and any field that depends on a locations, such as x, y, lon, lat, segment_id,\
        \ community, and others, will have default values. \n\nCaveats\n=======\n\n\
        As with most crime data, there are many issues, limitations and problems that\
        \ users must be aware of to avoid making incorrect conclusions. \n\n*Crime\
        \ incident data is inherently problematic.* Crime incident reports are collected\
        \ by busy officers in stressful situations who are trying to describe complex\
        \ situations with rigid categories. Virtually every point of the data collection\
        \ process has multiple opportunities for errors and few opportunities for\
        \ correction after the fact. Analysts must consider the difficulties of collecting\
        \ crime data when assessing the validity of any conclusions. \n\n*Data is\
        \ collected by 19 different agencies.* While the data is all sourced from\
        \ SANDAG, it originates with 19 different police departments. These departments\
        \ may have different policies that can result in different categorizations\
        \ for the same crime, and they may have different emphases on  which crimes\
        \ they pursue. \n\n*Many incidents at a single point.* Because all of the\
        \ crimes on a block are geocoded to the middle of the block, many incidents\
        \ will appear as a single point. \n\n*5% of crimes are not geocoded*. GIS\
        \ users should consider that about 5% of the incidents were not properly geocoded,\
        \ and are not included in the shapefiles. These crimes appear in the CSV files,\
        \ and can be included in time series analysis, but they will not be available\
        \ for spatial analysis. \n\n*Time and dates are often unreliable* Time and\
        \ dates for many incidents are unreliable, with times being more unreliable\
        \ than dates. \n\n  * Property crimes that occur while the owner is gone may\
        \ be recorded as the time a responsible person left the property, arrived\
        \ at the property to discover the crime, or the average between the two. There\
        \ is no information available to select among these possibilities, so these\
        \ incidents have very unreliable times. \n\n  * Because the time is unreliable,\
        \ so is the date, for crimes that occurred at night. \n\n  * Times may have\
        \ not been recorded in the original report. These times may be entered as\
        \ midnight, or as another time. \n\n\n*Multiple crime incidents may not have\
        \ all crimes recorded.* If a single person is charged with multiple violations\
        \ for a single arrest, departments may enter only the most serious charge,\
        \ the last charge, or all of the charges. There is no information to disambiguate\
        \ these possibilities. \n\n*Locations may be unreliable*. Crimes that involve\
        \ pursuits or violations committed and multiple locations may be recorded\
        \ and any of many different locations.  When the location is ambiguous, tt\
        \ is common for incidents to have the address recorded as the location where\
        \ the arrested person was charged. Because of this, the highest crime block\
        \ in San Diego is the downtown police station. Check high crime locations\
        \ to ensure they are not police stations. \n\n\nDataset Statistics\n==================\n\
